          For our final project, we were asked to write up a synopsis of what we learned and how we improved our
          Spaghetti bridges over time: Our first design consisted of twenty spaghetti's lined up in a rod shape and
          glued together. We came back a week later to find our design had been glued stuck to the cardboard it was
          resting on. Separating the bridge from the cardboard proved difficult and we wound up breaking the bridge in
          the process. For our second prototype, we decided to roll up the spaghetti's in a paper towel in order to
          prevent the brigade from sticking to the cardboard. Although this did end up working, much of the paper towel
          was stuck to the bridge and was inseparable. We later learned that this design could not be used on finals day
          due to the paper towel which was not one of the materials allowed in the design. After a few more attempts and
          design tweaks, we landed on a two-rod design with triangle supports between them. This proved successful at
          not sticking to cardboard due to some preliminary precautions we took. The design later went on to perform
          well. Some lessons we learned are how to distribute a load evenly across an object, how to ensure that our
          design is not too complex, and how to tweak the design to ensure ease and possibility of construction. And as
          our semester came to a close, we all learned valuable lessons about teamwork and engineering.

          We spent our Tuesday testing our final project together with the other engineering classes. Our bridge did
          well and it was interesting to see how other designs performed. Some groups incorporated trusses and triangles
          into their complex design while others relied more heavily on the wood glue in order to bear the weight of the
          water. This week is the final week and marks the end of our first semester.

          Following up from last week, we are continuing our construction and testing of our spaghetti bridges. Some
          designs held strong while having a bucket full of water hanging off of them. We thought about how and why some
          designs performed better than others and incorporated their strategies into our prototypes. Our score is
          graded based off of the weight of water it can support, divided by the weight of the bridge itself. This means
          that we must consider the weight of our bride as well when constructing our final design.

          Bridge. We are allowed one hundred pieces of uncooked spaghetti and our final design must use no more than
          twenty pieces. Four prototypes and one final bridge can be made in total. Throughout the week, we designed our
          bridges using Tinkercad, went over the logistics, began construction, and even tested a few bridge designs to
          see if they would function properly.

          Returning from Thanksgiving break, we are entering into the field of civil engineering, which, as we learned,
          has many sub-categories of its own. Everything from building design, seismic and stress analysis on objects,
          and even water management falls under this category.We were also briefed on our upcoming challenge and final
          project. The following photo refers to a simulation game we played in class called Freeways. In the game, we

          Continuing on the same note, we got more advanced and began constructing more advanced circuits. This is when
          programming in Arduino's custom language came in. Using it, we were able to make the led's in the circuit
          alternate and flash in any sequence we chose. Here in the picture, we were able to chain together many led's
          of various colors and have them flashing in a set pattern we chose.

          and some transistors and resistors. We were tasked with creating both series and parallel circuits just like
          we had done virtually last week. We measured the voltage, amperage, and resistance going through the circuit
          and filled out a worksheet with the number we would measure. Those who completed the task early were given the
          opportunity to walk around the classroom and teach the others how a circuit was properly constructed.

          In our eleventh week, we are moving into the field of environmental engineering. We learned how water is
          processed and treated at a facility in order to prevent damage to the environment. We learned that water
          filtration is a multi-stage process involving various types of filters, temperatures, pressures, and
          techniques. We then went on to build a water filter out of some given materials in order to filter some dirty
          water that was provided by our teacher. Some designs worked better than others at filtering the dirty water
          due to the order of the filtering materials that were put into the filter.

          During the week, we worked together on a water bottle rocket group project. First we had to do some research
          and think up a game plan and any design tweaks. Later on, we began the construction of the rocket, working as
          a group to make the process go smoothly. At the end of the week, we launched our rocket alongside the other
          group's rockets. Unfortunately, however, our rocket was not able to launch due to a pressurization failure
          caused by the lack of an airtite seal on the inside of the front cone. Regardless, we had fun and learned a
          lot in the process.

          This week we worked on two projects, one called the flying paper challenge, and another project about a water
          bottle rocket competition. In the flying paper challenge, we were tasked with creating a flying object using a
          single sheet of paper and hit a trash can a distance away with it. It was fun and similar to our second
          competition later on in the week. The water bottle rocket project had us create a rocket from a bottle that
          would go as far as possible. The general design is due by the end of the week and the competition will start
          early next week.

          topic today, going over prosthetics. Inspiration for prosthetics is usually inspired by nature and many
          aspects of bioengineering are tied into the making of them. On Wednesday, we were tasked with researching and
          creating a 3D model of a prosthetic for an animal of our choice. I went with a beak prosthetic for an Eagle

          multiple presentations on the topic and learned about the various parts of a computer and how they work
          together. Later on in the week, we took apart and rebuilt a laptop. While opening up the computer, we were
