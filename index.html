          Now we are going from theory to relaity for our electical engineering unit. We where each given a breadboard
          and some transisotrs and resistors. We were tasked with creating both seies and parellel circuts just like we had
          done virtually last week. We measured the voltage, amperage, and resistance going through the circut and filled out
          a worksheet with the number we would measure. Those who completed the task early where given the opourtunity to 
          walk around the classroom and teach the others how a circut was properly constructed.

          The next three weeks will be dedicated to one of the biggest feilds in engeneering; electrical engineering.
          During the begingin of the week we learned about electricity fundementals such as voltage, amperage,
          resistance and power through a presentation that the teacher gave us. Later on we played around with and made
          series and parellel ciruts virtually in tinkercad.

          In our tenth week, we are moving into the feild of environmental engineering. We learned how water is
          proccessed and treated at a facility in order to prevent damage to the environement. We learned that water
          filtration is a multi stage process involving varius types of filters, temperatures, pressures, and tecniques.
          We then went on to build a water filter out of some given materals in order to filter some dirty water that
          was provided by our teacher. Some designs worked better than other at filtering the dirty water due to the
          order of the filtering materials that was put into the filter.

          Duing the week we worked together on a water bottle rocket group prodject. First we had do some reaserch and
          think up a game plan and any design tweaks. Later on, we began the construction of the rocket, working as a
          group to make the process go smoothly. At the end of the week, we lauched our rocket alongside the other
          group's rokcets. Unfortunatly however, our rocket was not able to launch due to a presurization failure caused
          by the lack of an airtite seal on the inside of the front cone. Regardless, we had fun and learned a lot in
          the procces.

          This week we worked on two prodjects, one called the flying paper challenge, and another prodject about a
          water bottle rocket competition. In the flying paper challange, we were tasked with creating a flying object
          using a single sheet of paper and hit a trash can a distance away with it. It was fun and similar to our
          second competition later on in the week. The water bottle rocket prodjects had us create a rocket from a
          bottle that will go as far as possible. The general design is due by the end of the week and the competition
          will take early next week.

          Now we will be moving into our next area of engineering; bioengineering. Another presentation was given on the
          topic today going over prothetics. Inspiration for prostethics are usually inspired by nature and many aspects
          of bioengineering are tied into the making of them. On Wednesday we were tasked with researching and creating
          a 3D model of a prostethic for an aminal of our choise. I went with a beak prostheic for an Eagle and my peers
          had intresing ideas as well.

          This week we are tranisitoning away from mechanincal engineering, and into computer engineering. We listened
          to multiple presentations on the topic and learned about the various parts of a computer and how they work
          together. Later on in the week we took apart and rebuilt a laptop. While opening up the computer, we were
          tasked to indentify the differnt components and fill out a worksheet with what we learned from the disection.

          Our Rube Goldberd machine constuction is well on its way now, we have brought a custom lever from home due to
          it being difficult to construct from cardboard and tape alone. Our design was rather simple yet consistant.
          Failing on our first attemp, the machine later went on to preform as intended after a few simple tweaks to the
          design. Every group had an opourtunity to test this week and many

          This week we will begin custrustion on the Rube Goldberg Machine. Cutting up cardboard, taping down loose
          peices, and building the basic frame took place this week. We will soon be able to see the design go from the
          digital form into a phisical manifestation. Soon, hopefully, our design will be ready to test and tweak for
          optimal results.

          was chosen today in order to progress into the construciton phase. Most build materials will be provided in

          This week we took a cursory overview about workplace saftey and the various personal protective equipent used.
          After that we began brainstorming and sketching out our next prodject design; a Rube Goldberg Machine. A
          minimum of three simple machines should be used in this prodjecct in order to receive full credit. For our
          group prodject, we decided to go with a lever, an inclined plane, and a wheel and axel.

          This week was the first week in engineering class. We went over how to create and program a website that will
          house all of our text updates and notes of what we learned. The website is to be update on a weekly basis and
          uploading photographs of our work are recomended. Throughout the year, we will cover all of the various types
          of engineeringing and share on the website what we learned form group activities and presentations.
